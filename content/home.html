<p> I've been working with audio and music for a very long time.
 My introduction to music was the recorder and later the flute. A lot of the music I create nowadays is composed digitally which has many advantages. One advantage, is that I don't necessairily require a perfectly isolated recording room to work in, unless I am recording vocals. The various software I use includes programs such as Logic Pro X, Adobe Audition, and Audacity. My next goal is to find a new DAW (or music software) to work with other than Logic Pro X.
<br>
<br>
    

The reason for this change is due to the fact that Apple brand computers and applications do not often function on Windows. This is unfortunate as Logic Pro X is an excellent piece of software than has worked well for me for many years. A possible contender would be FL Studio. This software is a favourite amoung digitial music composers and even I am not blind to its benefits. I also use a variety of plugins, typically those that come with the software and instrument packs from Native Instruments and Kontact. These plugins are very versatile with an excellent sound quality. The producers use and manipulate actual recorded instruments in order to attain this quality.

<br>
<br>
    Of course another objective of mine is to experiment with my own sampling. I own a variety of wind instruments that have a nice sound quality to them that could be good for sampling. Currently I only have one year of study in violin but if I progress further in my lessons I have no doubt I that I would be able to record some excellent samples. Additionally, it is my hope that I will one day be able to properly play the piano. I often use a midi keyboard for my inputs but have never been formally taught the proper finger techniques that one would use on a piano.</p>

<h2>Cats</h2>

<p> Cats are amazing and incredibly cute creatures. They possess incredible eye sight and have a keen sense of smell. Their sense of smell is not as accuate as a dog's but is far superior to a human's. Cats are also natural born hunters and are great for keeping mice and rats out and far away. However, don't be surprised if your friendly feline companion happens to leave a "hunting trophy" at your front door. Regardless, in these situations the cat should be praised for its efforts as it believes it is bringing you a special treat.
<br>
<br>

Cats have a reputation for being more aloof than dogs. It's true that cats are over all more independant. A cat knows how to take care of itself in certain situations. For instance, cats are noctural and many like to go outside at night. While its owner may be up late worrying about it coming home the cat will often come back of its own accord when it feels like it provided it knows the area well and doesn't get startled by other wildlife. However, this doesn't necessairly mean that a cat will be less affectionate than a dog. Depending on the cat's personality (or 'purrsonality rather') it may be quite the attention seeker. A variety of factors come into play concerning a cat's personality. If the cat is brought into a loving home when it is young it will likely be conditioned to seek attention more often than an older feral cat that is adopted. It may take some time but most cats adjust to living with humans and display a certain affection towards their owners.
<br>
<br>
    Overall, cats are not particularly difficult to take care of. They are not required to go on walks but some cats can be labeled as 'outdoor' cats if they are in secure area where they can explore freely. Cats do need to be groomed from time to time or their coats may be become tangled, depending on the breed of cat, but most of the time cats will tend to their own grooming. Contrary to popular belief, cats do enjoy play time so long as owners are willing to put in the time. As hunters they will happily chase a ball or string and will be happy to take in some exercise. </p>

<h2>Cooking</h2>

<p> Cooking is vital skill that everyone should be taught. A great number of students entering their adult years do not know how to cook. It is my belief that cooking should become a more mandatory discipline in high school education. Thankfully, with the spread of the internet cooking tutorials are easy to come by not to mention easy to follow. And yet so many students still need to resort to ordering out for take out or cooking microwave meals.
<br>
<br>

Sometimes something as simple as a small plate of various food groups is enough to satisfy. Some pieces of fruit, vegetables, cheese, and sliced meat are easy to put together as they require little preparation. Another easy dish to make is pasta. Pasta can customized easily and a lot simple ingredients can be used to make it. A simple cheese sauce can be made simply with milk, butter, flour, cheese, and a dash or salt and pepper. Even easier to make a tomato sauce. The most basic tomato sauce only requires tomatos, butter, and salt and pepper but such a sauce can also be made more elaborate. The addional of beef or chicken and some additional vegetables such as mushrooms, spinach, peppers, and/or onions can really pump up the taste of your average tomato sauce. And of course cheese. Everything is better with cheese.

Here is a short and simple recipe on how to make chocolate mousse: The first step is to grate some high quality dark chocolate. This is the most tedious step in the process but worth the effort. Next step is to melt the chocolate. Thirdly, whisk two eggs and sugar together over heat until the mixture has doubled in volume, is light in colour, and warm to the touch. While the chocolate is cooling prepare the whipped cream (as much as needed). Once the chocolate is no longer hot all the ingredients can be mixed and chilled. Voila! And that is an easy and sure fire way to make chocolate mousse.</p>
